# Teaching Philosophy

At the heart of my teaching is a deep appreciation for the *"aha!"* moment — that powerful, transformative instant when a student gains clarity and connection. These moments of shared understanding have always energized my work as an educator. They remind me that learning is not merely the transfer of information, but the co-construction of meaning. My early approach drew heavily from **constructivist** principles: students build understanding through active inquiry, reflection, and engagement. I designed labs and assignments to provoke thinking, challenge assumptions, and encourage knowledge creation from the inside out.

But the world — and my perspective — has evolved. The disruptions brought by the global pandemic, and my personal journey as a parent of an autistic child, have taught me that **constructivism assumes too much**. It presumes students arrive ready to engage, with emotional self-regulation, foundational knowledge, and the motivation to learn. Increasingly, I’ve seen that many do not — through no fault of their own. This recognition has reshaped my teaching philosophy into something more compassionate and robust. Before we ask students to construct knowledge, we must ensure that the **ground is prepared**. I now believe that effective teaching must:
- Foster **psychological safety** and emotional readiness
- Clarify and reinforce **prerequisite understanding**
- Cultivate **motivation and relevance** in the task

Once this foundation is in place, students can truly thrive in a constructivist setting. My role is to **scaffold** not just content, but confidence. I guide students toward insight with deliberate structure, timely feedback, and a keen sensitivity to their readiness. Today, my philosophy blends:
- **Empathy and academic rigor**
- **Structure and flexibility**
- **Curiosity with compassion**

I still pursue those "aha" moments — but now I understand that they require more than clever explanations. They require **trust, support, and care**. As an educator, I build those conditions first — then help students build everything else.
