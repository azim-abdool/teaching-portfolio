# Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy centers on cultivating **curiosity, clarity, and capability**. I believe in:

- Encouraging independent thinking through inquiry-based learning
- Grounding abstract concepts with real-world applications
- Creating inclusive and motivating environments for diverse learners

I view teaching as a collaborative process, where mutual feedback drives growth.
