# Courses Taught

I primarily teach computer-systems related courses. Originally, I taught electronics-focused courses, with a slant toward digital systems, primarily with a strong focus on prototyping using FPGA-based systems. In the recent past, I was redeployed to teach more software and programming-focused courses, at all levels in the Department's curriculum. However, I've now been asked to take a role that bridges both the Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering Worlds. I've happily joined my first area of electronics with my recent past in software to yield my current teaching curricula focus on embedded or cyber-physical computing. 

## Embedded & Microprocessor Systems
I am currently heavily involved in teaching these courses. 
- ECNG2006 - Introduction to Microprocessors. This is a level 2 undergraduate course, and the undergrad students' first foray into the world of embedded systems. Prior to this course, they would have been introduced to both electronics and programming. This course bridges those concepts and introduces the student to exploiting a processor architecture using assembly to implement small-scale embedded systems involving the Microchip PIC 8-bit MCU. 
- ECNG2005, ECNG3006, ECNG3034 (Capstone)
- I've also supported ECNG3029 (Robotics) in the recent past as it aligns with my area of expertise. 

## Programming & Software Engineering 
I have taught these courses in the recent past. I still contribute to these courses, but I've now taken a more backseat role as a guest examiner and lecturer.
- UG Level 1: ECNG1009 - Introduction to Programming
- UG Level 2: ECNG2007 - Computer Systems and Software Design
- UG Level 3: ECNG3023 - Software Engineering
- Graduate: ECNG6613 - Database Systems

## Electronics 
I have delivered these courses in the past, but I no longer meaningfully contribute to them. 
- ECNG3016, ECNG2004, ECNG6601
