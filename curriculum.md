# Curriculum Development

I have contributed to curriculum innovation at both the course and programme level:

- Led course development for 13+ new courses in electronics, programming, and embedded systems
- Developed new laboratory assessments across 6 different courses
- Coordinated programme renewal and accreditation follow-up

Notable efforts include the rollout of the **CSEG Programme** and introduction of thematic, hands-on learning practices.
